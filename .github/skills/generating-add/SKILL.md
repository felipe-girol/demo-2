## Steps to follow:

### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous. Focus on:

- System Requirements: What are the key technical requirements?
- Constraints: Are there any technology or architecture constraints?
- Non-Functional Requirements: Are there any security, or scalability needs?

- Ensure each section is filled out with relevant information.
- Keep the document concise, aiming for clarity and brevity.

  - Respect any previous agent instructions.
  - Add any architectural rules, guidelines, or agent relevant behaviors
  - Follow the [Agents template](./AGENTS.md) provided in the context.
  - The file must be less than 100 sentences, than 100 characters each.
  
### Step 4: Review and Finalize

- Review the documents for completeness and accuracy.
- Write the final ADD to root folder with `ADD.md` name.
